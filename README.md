can be automated. This package contains a suite of useful tools to aid programming language design and implementation in

## Tools Included

- `syntax-tree` -- a base recursive tree implementation with traversal algorithms you extend to define an CST or AST
- `parser-gen` -- a generator that reads in an ANTLR grammar and creates a parser implementation that outputs a CST
- `symbol-table` -- a basic symbol table implementation for resolving bindings in an environment with nested scopes
- `typesystems` -- a library for defining type systems with algorithms for type checking and inference
- `tree-viz` -- a visual tool for navigating `syntax-tree` structures
