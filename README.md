# Kiruse's flavor of LDTK

**Utility library for language implementation in TypeScript.**

*This is a fork of the [original LDTK library by Terran One](https://github.com/terran-one/ldtk). It follows somewhat different design choices. As a sparetime project, this fork will likely not be actively developed or maintained.*

The purpose of this fork is to experiment with deep typing & inferrence rather than polymorphism. However, due to TypeScript's own limitations, the typing is too deep and TypeScript refuses to generate `.d.ts` files. If that is important to your project, please use the original project.
