# Language Development Toolkit

**Utility library for language implementation in TypeScript.**

The **Language Development Toolkit (LDTK)** is a utility library that simplifies the process of implementing a
programming language in TypeScript. LDTK provides tools and abstractions for common tasks that arise when creating a new
language, allowing developers to focus on the unique aspects of their language rather than reinventing the wheel.

**This project is a heavy Work-in-Progress.**
